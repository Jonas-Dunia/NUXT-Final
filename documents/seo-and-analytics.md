# SEO & Analytics Overview (What I learned)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) helps search engines understand and rank your pages. Clear content structure matters (e.g., one `<h1>` per page, then `<h2>`–`<h6>` as needed). Avoid “ghost pages” or hidden text; search engines penalize manipulative tactics. Quality backlinks (legitimate, content-driven links into and out of your site) plus good on-page structure are key. Done well, you earn organic traffic, which users tend to trust more than ads. To measure results, track KPIs (are visitors doing what you wanted—signups, purchases, etc.?) using analytics tools. Heatmaps also reveal where users focus on your pages. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Analytics & resources.** Google Analytics can show who visited and what they clicked. Moz has beginner-friendly guides, and you can add social meta tags so links look good when shared (Open Graph for Facebook and Twitter Cards for X/Twitter). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

# Ideal SEO Implementation for My Site

**Technical & global defaults.**  
- Set global defaults in `nuxt.config.ts` → `app.head` (title template, default description, canonical URL, Open Graph/Twitter tags, favicon).  
- Ensure each page has exactly one `<h1>`, clear headings, and descriptive alt text on images.  
- Provide a default social image (`/og-default.jpg`) and canonical links.  

**Page-by-page enhancements.**  
- Use page-specific titles and descriptions with Nuxt’s `useHead()` / `useSeoMeta()` so each page can override the default description.  
- Add structured data (JSON-LD) to key pages (e.g., WebSite / Organization schema) as a bonus.  

**Content & links.**  
- Write concise, human-readable copy that includes the keywords users actually search for.  
- Link internally between related pages and earn relevant external backlinks by publishing useful content.  

**Measurement.**  
- Add Google Analytics (or a privacy-friendly alternative) to track KPIs and conversions; optionally use a heatmap tool to see what users engage with most. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
